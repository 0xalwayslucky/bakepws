# Bakepws - Create a password list using hashcat rules
**Bakepws.py** uses [hashcat](https://github.com/hashcat) underneath to generate different lists based on the words supplied via input file, so it has to be installed on the system in order to work.
The [hashcat rules](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack) supplied are applied to every word in the input file.
After the lists are generated, each word generated by hashcat is joined with every other word in the other lists generated and thus results in a password list with every possible combination of the generated words.

**See examples for more**
* dough.txt == input file
* receipt.rule == hashcat rule
* cake.txt == output file


```
> python3 bakepws.py
Creating a password list with hashcat rules.

Description:
This tool takes words seperated by newlines from a file,
generates for each word a list based on the hashcat rules supplied (using hashcat) and
creates a wordlist with all possible combinations of the words that have been generated.
Mmmmmm delicious.

Usage:
python3 bakepws.py -i <input-file> -r <hashcat-rule>

With no output file, print to standard output

-i:         path/to/input.file
-r:         path/to/hashcat.rule
-o:         path/to/output.file
--cat:      path/to/hashcat

example:
python3 bakepws.py -i examples/dough.txt -r examples/recipe.rule -o examples/cake.txt
```
