# Bakepws - Baking Passwords With Ease
**Bakepws.py** creates a wordlist with all possible combinations based on the words supplied via input file.

When supplying a [hashcat rule](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=rule_based_attack) bakepws.py uses [hashcat](https://github.com/hashcat) underneath to generate different lists, so it has to be installed on the system in order to work.
The hashcat rules are applied to every word from the input file.
After the lists are generated, each word generated by the given rules is combined with every other word in the other lists generated and thus results in a password list with every possible combination of the generated lists.

**Usage**
```
> python3 bakepws.py
Creating a password-list with ease. 

Usage:
python3 bakepws.py [OPTIONS] -i <input-file>

With no output file, print to standard output

      -i:     path/to/input.file
      -r:     path/to/hashcat.rule
      -o:     path/to/output.file
   --cat:     path/to/hashcat

Examples:
python3 bakepws.py -i examples/dough.txt
python3 bakepws.py -i examples/dough.txt -r examples/recipe.rule -o examples/cake.txt
```
